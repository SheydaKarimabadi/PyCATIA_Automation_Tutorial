Automate CATIA with Python | PyCATIA Tutorial 🚀

This repository contains all the files and code examples from my YouTube tutorial on automating CATIA design using Python and the PyCATIA library.

## 📌 What’s inside?
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with step-by-step code


## 🔧 Requirements
- CATIA V5 installed
- Python 3.x
- PyCATIA library


## 📂 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   `bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pycatia-automation-tutorial.git

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow along with the video.



✅ Why This Matters?

Automating CATIA workflows with Python saves time, reduces repetitive work, and generates valuable data for analysis and machine learning applications — the same approach top OEMs use.
